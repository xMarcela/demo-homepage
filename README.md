# demo-homepage

Building upon what I learnt under the previous projects to develop a version one homepage.
This is a responsive page built with focus on Bootstrap and understanding the framework process.

Here I learned to become more mindfull on the code structure early on in the planning process,
so to become quicker to plan and build the codes in a better way freeing up more of the process time.
